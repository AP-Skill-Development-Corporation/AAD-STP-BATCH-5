			Match_parent:It will match entire screen(either with or height )
			Wrap_content :Only part of 
		Dynamic:
			300dp,400dp,(Dp Means Device Independent Pixel) for all components /view and view groups 
			For textviews:20sp,30sp,500sp…(Sp means Scale independent Pixel ) for only textviews 
Layouts:This are the ViewGrops 
	ex:Linear layout,Relative layout,ConstarinLayou..etc

Create our own android application  :
	Hello Toast App Creation

	Buttion(Toast)
